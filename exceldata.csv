OS-732 cells grew to high population density in liquid medium and formed colonies in agar medium. The cell line consisted of polygonal or fusiform cells resembling the cells of the original tumor. No collagen fibers or calcium apatite microcrystals could be demonstrated in the cultured cells by electron microscopy nor were virus particles detected. Isoenzyme studies of the cell line revealed the “B” band of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Chromosome studies of the cell line revealed a range of stem line number from 58 to 65; chromosome counts ranged from 47 to 183.

From the initial screening, five distinct IIF specificities were detected. Cultures representative of each of the IIF specificities were expanded in selective medium without aminopterine, and hybridoma lines were subsequently cloned in semi-solid agar overlayed with medium. Hybridoma 25.77 was one of them. Monoclonal antibody 25.77 belongs to the subclass IgG2a. It was found that 25.77 bound to antigens only present in merozoites, free and within mature schizonts.

This interaction induces a structural rearrangement creating a high affinity binding site for a chemokine coreceptor like CXCR4 and/or CCR5. This peculiar 2 stage receptor-interaction strategy allows gp120 to maintain the highly conserved coreceptor-binding site in a cryptic conformation, protected from neutralizing antibodies. Surface protein gp120 (SU) may target the virus to gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) by binding host ITGA4/ITGB7 (alpha-4/beta-7 integrins), a complex that mediates T-cell migration to the GALT. The surface protein gp120 is also a ligand for CD209/DC-SIGN and CLEC4M/DC-SIGNR, which are respectively found on dendritic cells (DCs), and on endothelial cells of liver sinusoids and lymph node sinuses. These interactions allow capture of viral particles at mucosal surfaces by these cells and subsequent transmission to permissive cells.",Protein>Others

Diseases caused by P. capsici are polycyclic in that multiple cycles of infection and inoculum production occur in a single growing season. The pathogen survives unfavorable conditions in soil by forming thickwalled oospores, while dissemination and infection are achieved through the production of motile biflagellate zoospores from oospores. The zoospores swim through water in the soil and are chemotactically attracted to the exudates released by the roots of potential host plants. After the zoospores have adhered to the root surface, they encyst and produce a precisely oriented germ tube that grows into adjacent host plant tissue.",Miscellaneous

The Empirical formula of Biotin is C10H16O3N2S, with an unusual structure composed of a ureido (tetrahydroimidizalone) ring fused with a tetrahydrothiophene ring. Biotin is necessary for cell growth, the production of fatty acids, and the metabolism of fats and amino acids. It plays a role in the citric acid cycle, which is the process by which biochemical energy is generated during aerobic respiration. Biotin not only assists in various metabolic reactions but also helps to transfer carbon dioxide. Biotin may also be helpful in maintaining a steady blood sugar level.
