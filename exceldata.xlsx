The above procedure was performed and then purified protein was treated with TEV protease (100 µl at 2.5 mg/ml per 10 mg of protein) for 24 h at 4 °C using dialysis (Slidelyzer 10K, Thermo Scientific) versus 0.15 M NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol and 3 mM reduced glutathione/ 0.3 mM oxidized glutathione. The repurified PCSK9ΔP'protein (Superdex 75 column) was homogenous and had the expected mass, consistent with the loss of the N-terminal sequence 153SIPWNLERITPPR165ENLYFQ (ENLYFQ is TEV cleavage sequence). The new N terminus of the PCSK9 catalytic domain was SA168 (the serine is from the TEV cleavage sequence), which was confirmed by N-terminal sequencing. Therefore, the PCSK9ΔP'construct is missing the first 15 residues of its native N-terminal sequence (153SIPWNLERITPPRYR167).",Protein>Others

This interaction induces a structural rearrangement creating a high affinity binding site for a chemokine coreceptor like CXCR4 and/or CCR5. This peculiar 2 stage receptor-interaction strategy allows gp120 to maintain the highly conserved coreceptor-binding site in a cryptic conformation, protected from neutralizing antibodies. Surface protein gp120 (SU) may target the virus to gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) by binding host ITGA4/ITGB7 (alpha-4/beta-7 integrins), a complex that mediates T-cell migration to the GALT. The surface protein gp120 is also a ligand for CD209/DC-SIGN and CLEC4M/DC-SIGNR, which are respectively found on dendritic cells (DCs), and on endothelial cells of liver sinusoids and lymph node sinuses. These interactions allow capture of viral particles at mucosal surfaces by these cells and subsequent transmission to permissive cells.",Protein>Others

The pathogen survives unfavorable conditions in soil by forming thickwalled oospores, while dissemination and infection are achieved through the production of motile biflagellate zoospores from oospores. The zoospores swim through water in the soil and are chemotactically attracted to the exudates released by the roots of potential host plants. After the zoospores have adhered to the root surface, they encyst and produce a precisely oriented germ tube that grows into adjacent host plant tissue.",Miscellaneous
